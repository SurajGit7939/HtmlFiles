<b><i></i></b>Made from neutral grains such as rye, barley, wheat and corn, gin remains unaged, and is clear, like vodka. The herbal and pine-like aroma of gin comes from the inclusion of botanical ingredients like juniper berries.

Gin has a dry — meaning not sweet — taste that pairs with cocktails that also are not sweet. Here are some favorite gin mixed drinks.

Gin martini: Shake or stir gin and dry vermouth with an optional dash of bitters. Top with olives or a twist of lemon to complete this classic drink.
Gin and tonic: Create this easy cocktail to your preference with a simple combination of tonic water, gin and lime.
Tom Collins: Take gin, lemon juice, simple syrup and club soda in a Collins glass to start this cocktail. Top with a maraschino cherry and a lemon or orange slice.
Gin fizz: Similar to a Tom Collins, a gin fizz uses gin, lemon juice and simple syrup shaken with an optional egg white and finished off with soda water.
Cocktails made with gin usually do not have many other components since the spirit already has more flavor than the other types of liquors out there. Despite its herbal flavor, most people do not consume gin straight, as you may with other spirits. This clear liquor is a worldwide favorite and usually ranges from 35 to 40% alcohol content
